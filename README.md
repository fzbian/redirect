# Redirect

This is a small server-side code used to redirect users to another page. It can be useful for logging visits to the original page and the page being redirected to. This can help you measure traffic and understand how users interact with your website. In addition, it can also be used to create a personalized user experience, sending users to different pages based on their behavior or interests.
